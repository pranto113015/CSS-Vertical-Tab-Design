                    <p>Contrary to popular belief, Lorem Ipsum is not simply random text. It has roots in a piece of
                        classical Latin literature from 45 BC, making it over 2000 years old. Richard McClintock, a
                        Latin professor at Hampden-Sydney College in Virginia, looked up one of the more obscure Latin
                        words, consectetur, from a Lorem Ipsum passage, and going through the cites of the word in
                        classical literature, discovered the undoubtable source. Lorem Ipsum comes from sections 1.10.32
                        and 1.10.33 of "de Finibus Bonorum et Malorum" (The Extremes of Good and Evil) by Cicero,
                        written in 45 BC. This book is a treatise on the theory of ethics, very popular during the
                        Renaissance. The first line of Lorem Ipsum, "Lorem ipsum dolor sit amet..", comes from a line in
                        section 1.10.32.</p>

                <div class="blog text">
                    <div class="title">Blog Content</div>
                    <p>There are many variations of passages of Lorem Ipsum available, but the majority have suffered
                        alteration in some form, by injected humour, or randomised words which don't look even slightly
                        believable. If you are going to use a passage of Lorem Ipsum, you need to be sure there isn't
                        anything embarrassing hidden in the middle of text. All the Lorem Ipsum generators on the
                        Internet tend to repeat predefined chunks as necessary, making this the first true generator on
                        the Internet. It uses a dictionary of over 200 Latin words, combined with a handful of model
                        sentence structures, to generate Lorem Ipsum which looks reasonable. The generated Lorem Ipsum
                        is therefore always free from repetition, injected humour, or non-characteristic words etc.</p>

                    <div class="title">Help Content</div>
                    <p>It is a long established fact that a reader will be distracted by the readable content of a page
                        when looking at its layout. The point of using Lorem Ipsum is that it has a more-or-less normal
                        distribution of letters, as opposed to using 'Content here, content here', making it look like
                        readable English. Many desktop publishing packages and web page editors now use Lorem Ipsum as
                        their default model text, and a search for 'lorem ipsum' will uncover many web sites still in
                        their infancy. Various versions have evolved over the years, sometimes by accident, sometimes on
                        purpose (injected humour and the like).</p>

                    <p>But I must explain to you how all this mistaken idea of denouncing pleasure and praising pain was
                        born and I will give you a complete account of the system, and expound the actual teachings of
                        the great explorer of the truth, the master-builder of human happiness. No one rejects,
                        dislikes, or avoids pleasure itself, because it is pleasure, but because those who do not know
                        how to pursue pleasure rationally encounter consequences that are extremely painful. Nor again
                        is there anyone who loves or pursues or desires to obtain pain of itself, because it is pain,
                        but because occasionally circumstances occur in which toil and pain can procure him some great
                        pleasure. To take a trivial example, which of us ever undertakes laborious physical exercise,
                        except to obtain some advantage from it? But who has any right to find fault with a man who
                        chooses.</p>
